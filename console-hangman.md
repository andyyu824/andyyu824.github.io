Python was the second programming I learned and prior to working with it, I was still very uncomfortable with coding let alone starting a personal project. I had two semesters of Java for experience, but I still struggled with the basic concepts or even how to start a new project in an IDE. Python was a change of pace and gave me the opportunity to learn a new language, IDE, and nuances from the groud up. Though the syntax was simple to learn, I had to study many resources to learn how to navigate IDLE, PyCharm, the command line and other developer tools. After many tutorials and coding challenges, I undertook hangman as my first project and made it my goal to add as many features as I could with what knowledge I had at the time.

The logic behind it is very straightforward, hangman is a simple game. For me, the difficulty was in implementing more 'pythonic' code and learning scope. I wanted to practice enumeration and list comprehension and gaining the understanding to properly execute them took me a couple days of study. In addition, I always and still struggle a little with scope. I lock my programs in while true loops and have difficulty identifying where to place the loop or what to place in it. From this project, I was able to gain first hand experience outside of a tutorial and that greatly improved my understanding. 

The whole project is less than 70 lines of code, but it took me several days to get running. Eventually I managed to learn how to run my project from the command line and add a simple visual to the game. When I have the time, my next step is to create a GUI for the game.
