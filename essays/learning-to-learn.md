For two years in high school, I had a Chinese language teacher. I have since forgotten most of the mandarin I learned, but I will never forget her more fundamental lessons. Whenever she would scold the class, she would say, “You need to learn how to learn”. There are many levels to learning, after all, everyone is a beginner at some point in their journey. Memorization is said to be the most fundamental, it is simple and monotonous. As one progresses through their journey to learn, they inevitably begin to ask questions and I still believe that there are no dumb questions. There is a time and a place for everything, but it is when questioners disregard this that they are berated. “What is a for loop?” I promise that no one is born knowing what a for loop is and the question will be asked at some point. Asking this in an introduction to programming course is completely valid and anyone that mocks such a question is doing so for anyone’s benefit. However, if you have access to the internet and rather than performing a quick Google search, you slap your question onto the front page of StackOverflow, there is a very high likelihood that your post will be closed before anyone has the chance to see it.

I understand the urge, as a complete beginner myself, I often find that I do not even know where to begin to learn something. It is only through hours or study that I have come to learn where to find resources and how to ask a question. By learning how to learn, I have opened many opportunities for my growth. I thought Eric Raymond put together a great beginner’s guide that both encourages beginners whilst poking some fun at them. With this in mind, though it is true that programmers or “hackers” are known to be a touchy crowd, I found it surprisingly difficult to find a poor question on StackOverflow with any harsh replies. 

One post titled, “How to send 100,000 emails weekly” had 146 downvotes before being closed. The question is both broad and suspicious. If one intends to email blast 100,000 people, is it for work? Or are they building a spam bot? The post has no details regarding what the poster knows, has tried, or intends to do with the information. It is akin to asking, “How do I hack my ex’s email?” Despite this, the three main answers for the question go into considerable depth regarding the pros and cons of such a venture as well as possible ways to execute it. Although this poster may have received responses from generous users, the downvotes reflect the general disapproval of the community.

On the other hand, a solid question can lead to great discussion and growth for posters and readers. For example, “Is Java ‘pass-by-reference’ or ‘pass-by-value’?” The post is brief, solid questions need not be long, but the question is solid and opens the door to discussion. The question is concise and specific enough to be answered. In this case, it pertains to a very technical aspect of Java that does require the insight of experienced users to answer. The difference in response is clear with 6706 upvotes and 81 answers from the community, many of which with thousands of upvotes themselves. This post can be found here at: [StackOverflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40480/is-java-pass-by-reference-or-pass-by-value).

The desire to learn is always admirable, but one must put in the effort to do so. Just as one does not learn by memorizing lines of code or simply copying answers to assignments, there is nothing gained from inappropriate questions either. No matter what you call it, “Learning how to learn” or “How to ask questions the smart way”, this fundamental step will ensure boundless growth.
