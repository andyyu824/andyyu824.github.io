I understand that some may find coding standards to be more an annoyance than beneficial, but I could not imagine collaborating with others let alone working for a company without the use of coding standards. The brilliance of coding standards is that no matter how many people you work with, the format of everyone’s code will be identical. In addition to this, IDEs now make implementing coding standards a trivial matter. Simply load the appropriate files and settings and you are on your way. The system itself will notify you of discrepancies and many easy fixes can be resolved with the click of a button. 

Still can’t be bothered? Every company will have their own standards or at least follow other universal standards. Rather than learning an entirely new system from scratch when working for or with different people, loading coding standards onto your IDE is simple and effective. The importance of this is obvious when working with version control. Code simply will not run if everyone has their own interpretation of format, indentations, etc. Also, from a purely aesthetic standpoint, who would want to read code with spaces all over the place, lacking uniformity? 

Many developers are free-lance and hardly collaborate with others. Their clients do not care about spaces, they just want a website. Although some programs run perfectly well whether their lines has 4 or 6 spaces of indentation, maintaining consistency for an entire program is difficult. If a program with thousands or even hundreds of lines were to break simply due to a single missing semi-colon, it would be frustrating for anyone to have to identify this problem let alone find where it is. An IDE with a coding standard loaded would catch any of these trivial mistakes.

It is easy to be one to be set in their ways, why fix what isn’t broken? The same is usually said when students learn a new language, new tools, or even new functions. Learning underscore.js took me hours and frustrated me to no end. Of course I cursed it at first, but after a couple weeks of practice I dread writing programs without underscore functions. Again, it could be done without learning new tools, but they only increase one’s efficiency. Three cheers for coding standards!
