I first began my journey in programming and computer science in Fall 2020 with my first day of ICS 111 lecture. I came into the field having graduated just recently with a degree in Cell and Molecular Biology, confident that I would coast to a degree that could land me a job as a “Programmer”. My first year has been a hair-pulling wake up call and frequent nights of existential dread. 

Everyone said that the first language would be the toughest to learn and it was, at times, an upsetting experience. Upon realizing that most students now graduate from high school with some programming experience, I felt left behind, and I was desperate to catch up. I studied frequently and professors referred me to coding challenge sites for practice, but the coding challenges were demoralizing. With that being said, I eventually hobbled away with a shaky understanding of Java. Battered from my two semesters working with the same language, I decided to learn Python, which was difficult but far more enjoyable. I began to see my fundamentals coming to play. After Python was SQL and many coding challenges. It has never been easy, but I am no longer afraid of learning programming languages. Learning Javascript has been a much better experience and I now know enough to appreciate the unique traits of the language such as its flexibility and the tools provided in ES6. Indeed, it is called Javascript but feels more closely related to Python in the way that you can access strings and the freedom from data type declarations. 

Coming into the course, I was nervous of learning a new language for use in the course and the WODs. Although it is still very early in the semester, I am finding the work more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The WODs have been an opportunity to practice both problem solving and using Javascript. Even when I do not know the answer straightaway, I know how to find hints without ruining the point of the exercise. 

I am not knowledgeable enough to have an educated opinion of how Javascript as a language fits into the landscape of software engineering, but I always appreciate the opportunity to learn and hone new languages and skills. On the one hand, naysayers refuse to even categorize it as a programming language but rather a scripting language. A lot of people had their feathers ruffled when they learned that Javascript recently helped send people into space. I do not know enough to have biases, but I do appreciate how dynamic the language is and no one can refute how widespread its applications are. I think that it will be a challenging but fun and rewarding semester. Maybe check back with me in a month.
